## BST

A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a tree in which all the nodes follow the below-mentioned properties −
 - The left sub-tree of a node has a key less than or equal to its parent node's key.
 - The right sub-tree of a node has a key greater than to its parent node's key.
 
## Representation

BST is a collection of nodes arranged in a way where they maintain BST properties. Each node has a key and an associated value. While searching, the desired key is compared to the keys in BST and if found, the associated value is retrieved.

We observe that the root node key (27) has all less-valued keys on the left sub-tree and the higher valued keys on the right sub-tree.

## Basic Operations

- Search − Searches an element in a tree.
- Insert − Inserts an element in a tree.
- Pre-order Traversal − Traverses a tree in a pre-order manner.
- In-order Traversal − Traverses a tree in an in-order manner.
- Post-order Traversal − Traverses a tree in a post-order manner.
